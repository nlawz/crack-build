<IntroImage />

crack.dev is a product that is geared towards product engineers, indie hackers, solopreneurs, and anybody looking to create their own software. It's the documentation that I wish I had access to when I was getting started. Apart from the resources and general purpose guides found on this site, crack.dev consists of two core components:

- a collection of UI components, designed around ShadCN
- a collection of tRPC and API routes (Coming Soon)

These are opionated choices, and these are the technologies that you are tying yourself to when using crack.dev. We strive to keep our dependecy footprint as small as possible and avoid "Saas glue" when possible.

## Technologies Used
- Next.js
- tRPC
- postgres
- Lucia/Clerk
- ShadCN
