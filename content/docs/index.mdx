crack.dev is a product that is geared towards product engineers, indie hackers, solopreneurs, and anybody looking to create their own software. It's goal is to speed up product development times and allow developers to focus on the business logic of their application without having to spend so much time getting the basics up and running. Apart from the resources and general purpose guides found on this site, crack.dev consists of two core components:

- a collection of UI components, designed around ShadCN
- a collection of fullstack components, such as auth-flows, api routes, and more

These are opionated choices, and these are the technologies that you are tying yourself to when using crack.dev. We strive to keep our dependecy footprint as small as possible and avoid "Saas glue" when possible.

## Technologies Used
